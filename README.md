# Czech RealRTCW

A Czech translation of dubbing and all text in RealRTCW (a mod for Return to Castle Wolfenstein).

## How to install

### Steam mod

**WIP**

### Custom installation

1. Locate the mod folder, if installed via Steam it will be in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RealRTCW\Main`.
2. Download the `Archives` folder from this repository.
3. Use a program like Altap Salamander to open the `z_realrtcw_sounds.pk3` archive without extracting it and insert all sound files from the `z_realrtcw_sounds` folder into it (**Reason**: GitHub doesn't allow to upload files bigger than 100 MB).
4. Replace the game archives with the downloaded archives.
5. Enjoy! Everything should be working now.

## More technical view at this repository

- **Archives** = Contain all translated files for the mod itself.
- **Fonts** = Fonts used in ImageEdits files.
- **ImageEdits** = Contain project files for the translated levelshots, menus, etc. (Files made in GIMP).
